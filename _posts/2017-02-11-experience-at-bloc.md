title: Bloc Thus Far
---

I've been going through my apprenticeship with Bloc for the past 5 months now. So far, Bloc has exceeded my expectations. I came into the course knowing that I would work my butt off. Since starting, I've done that and some. What I've found to be the most surprising is that the work is much more challenging than I'd originally envisioned. Web development takes serious critical thinking prowess and an analytical mindset. Becoming the type of person has been the most difficult thing to do so far. I've found myself having to repeat challenges because I've failed to implement things correctly. As I continue through the program, that is the thing I try to continuously improve upon.
